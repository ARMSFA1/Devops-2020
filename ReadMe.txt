##### Summary
After listing to the presentation by the various lecturers, I ended up settling on the Devop's group. The primary reason for this being how it relates to my previous course work. I've completed Linux and Security classes in the past, am currently working my way through an Operations Engineering Paper and am hoping to do System Administration in the future. As a result of this, I thought it would be the group that would allow me to best focus my skills into something that's applicable to the work force, which I will be entering into as a trained professional next year.
