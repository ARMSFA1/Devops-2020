#### Week One

##### Summary
After listing to the presentation by the various lecturers, I ended up settling on the Devop's group. The primary reason for this being how it relates to my previous course work. I've completed Linux and Security classes in the past, am currently working my way through an Operations Engineering Paper and am hoping to do System Administration in the future. As a result of this, I thought it would be the group that would allow me to best focus my skills into something that's applicable to the work force, which I will be entering into as a trained professional next year.


#### Week Two

##### Summary

On Friday I was rostered on to check on the D312 PC kits. This cabling up each of the sixteen PC's, booting them up, checking the ability to login and making sure there was internet access. During this task, I was recording my results, listing the time each PC was checked, the issue, if there is one, and whatever solution I used to solve this issue. The few issues that I couldn't figure out I detailed and informed Rob of. A copy of the report that I compiled can be found within this repository. In total this took a little over two and a half hours.
