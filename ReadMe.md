#### Week One

##### Summary
After listing to the presentation by the various lecturers, I ended up settling on the Devop's group. The primary reason for this being how it relates to my previous course work. I've completed Linux and Security classes in the past, am currently working my way through an Operations Engineering Paper and am hoping to do System Administration in the future. As a result of this, I thought it would be the group that would allow me to best focus my skills into something that's applicable to the work force, which I will be entering into as a trained professional next year.


#### Week Two

##### Summary

On Friday I was rostered on to check on the D312 PC kits. This cabling up each of the sixteen PC's, booting them up, checking the ability to login and making sure there was internet access. During this task, I was recording my results, listing the time each PC was checked, the issue, if there is one, and whatever solution I used to solve this issue. The few issues that I couldn't figure out I detailed and informed Rob of. A copy of the report that I compiled can be found within this repository. In total this took a little over two and a half hours. I then took the form that I created and cleared out my input, leaving only the template I created and uploaded it to the Devop's Team's group so others can use it, ensuring we keep the same format.

##### Tutorial Task

Having finally gained access to my AWS (Amazon Web Services) account, I was able to begin the [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/module-one/) given to us by Faisal to gain a basic understanding of the kind of work that we will be doing in Devops. The main timesink of the project, in my experience, was getting all of the required software working.

#### Week Two

##### Summary

At the beginning of this week I spoke with Faisal to identify some goals moving forward on what I should be doing. We identified what I'm interested in and where my goals are into three different areas. Wanting to obtain the AWS Certification, I estimate that it will take up 40% of my time moving forward. Additionally, we singled out my interest in writing scripts, meaning that the remainder of my time should be dedicated to writing scripts and operations tasks with Rob.

I've been given of writing a powershell script. The script in question will be required to indentify if a computer has been idle for five or more minutes and then shut it down. This will then be deployed across our micro-machines.
